    "\n",
    "Another very popular way to obtain vector representations of text is through *word embeddings*. Embeddings are *short* (typical sizes: 100-1'000), *dense* (contain mostly non-zero values) and \"embed\" meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are *learned* from the data using neural networks by looking at the context around a certain word. This allows to capture the \"relative meaning\" of a word. The \"quality\" of word vectors increases significantly with the amount of training data. Embeddings also are available as \"off-the-shelf\"  \"pre-trained\" embeddings. They are usually trained on large, general purpose corpora (e.g. Wikipedia) or more specialized corpora (\"context\" matters!). \n",

The general idea behind these methods is that two words are more similar if they share similar contexts.
